Electric Motors

The history of electric motors spans centuries, beginning with early experiments in electromagnetism. In the 1820's, Michael Faraday's work laid the foundation for the modern electric motor, demonstrating that electric currents could create mechanical motion. This breakthrough led to the development of the first practical electric motor by Thomas Davenport in the 1830's. Davenport's motor could generate rotational movement and was a significant advancement in the field.

Infrastructure

Electric vehicles did exist in niche markets in the early 1900's, favored for their clean and quiet operation, especially in urban areas. However, technological limitations and the advantages of internal combustion engines in terms of range, refueling, and manufacturing capabilities led to the widespread use of gasoline-powered vehicles during that era. It took several decades and advancements in battery technology, coupled with environmental concerns, for electric vehicles to regain popularity and become a viable alternative to gasoline cars.

Batteries

In the late 19th century, the development of the lead-acid battery by Gaston Plant√© and improvements by Thomas Edison made electric vehicles more practical. Lead-acid batteries provided a reliable source of energy for these early electric cars, contributing to their popularity. The development of batteries is a complex process influenced by a variety of factors. While it's tempting to consider whether batteries could have been created more quickly, it's essential to recognize the challenges and constraints that have shaped their history.

It wasn't until the late 20th century, with the rise of consumer electronics and later the push for electric vehicles and renewable energy storage, that there was a surge in research and development investment. This shift in demand and focus accelerated battery technology considerably.

Development

A pivotal moment in history before the 2000's when electric cars could have been developed and refined more extensively was during the oil crises of the 1970's. The oil shocks of 1973 and 1979, driven by geopolitical conflicts and supply disruptions in the Middle East, led to a sudden and sharp increase in oil prices, which prompted concerns about energy security and the dependence on fossil fuels.

During this period, there was a heightened interest in alternative energy sources, including electric vehicles, as a means to reduce reliance on oil. Governments and automakers began to invest in electric car research and development. For example, in the United States, the Electric and Hybrid Vehicle Research, Development, and Demonstration Act of 1976 provided federal funding for electric vehicle projects. Automakers like General Motors and Ford experimented with electric car prototypes, such as the GM EV1.

However, despite this initial interest and investment, the technology of the time was still limited. Battery technology had not yet reached a level of efficiency and affordability that could make electric cars practical for mainstream consumers. Additionally, the oil crises were eventually mitigated, leading to a decrease in urgency for alternative energy solutions.
